## Introduction
Hello my name is Valerie! I am currently in 12th grade and I am 17 years young. I am in my last year of highschool which truly did go by extremely fast. I've taken the time over these four years to grow as a person and a student, where I have been given the opportunity to learn new things and meet new people who I consider some of my best friends. Throughout my highschool career I have developed an even deeper enjoyment to my english classes where I have developed my love for writing. In fact, one of my greatest achievements thus far has been scoring a 5 on my AP Lang exam last year. I also absolutely love to read as it is something I spend a lot of my freetime doing. My current favorite book is called Binding 13 as it was extremely well written and was also the first book that I had ever finished that was over 500 pages. I hope that one day I'll be able to write my own book for the experience.
