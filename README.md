## Introduction
   Hello my name is Valerie! I am currently in 12th grade and I am 17 years young. I am in my last year of highschool which truly did go by extremely fast. I've taken the time over these four years to grow as a person and a student, where I have been given the opportunity to learn new things and meet new people who I consider to be some of my best friends. Throughout my highschool career I have developed an even deeper enjoyment to my english classes where I have developed my love for writing. In fact, one of my greatest achievements thus far has been scoring a 5 on my AP Lang exam last year. I also absolutely love to read as it is something I spend a lot of my freetime doing. My current favorite book is called Binding 13 as it was extremely well written and was also the first book that I had ever finished that was over 500 pages. I hope that one day I'll be able to write my own book for the experience. I also really love building Legos, so much so that I have a room in my home dedicated to my current collection. I find legos give me peace and the right amount of complexity that my mind enjoys. 

   Over the summer, I spent a tong of time with my friens where we would go out to the beach or just hang out doing random activities throughout our days. I also had a lot of fun with my family, having taken a roadtrip to Las vegas for four days and going to DisneyLand for two. I really had a great time being around the people I loved and doing fun excursions that I hadn't done in years. During the summer, there were two different events that really stood out to me, making them incredibly memorable. The first happened at the beginning of the summer where a bunch of our friends went to the beach for my best friend's birthday. That day was spent being in the presence of my favorite people that felt very wholesome and almost emotional knowing how far we'd come as friends. The second event had to do with the DinseyLand trip this summer which was a very heartfelt one to me becasue it was my younger sister's first time being there. Seeing her enjoy herself so much the way I did as a kid really stood out to me.  

  This school year I aspire to finish off with having good grades and generally taking enjoyment in being in my classes this year, given its my last with the same people i've grown around. I am excited to gain some new experiences and skills and hope to have a good time. I will also be applying to colleges very soon, my top schools being UC Berkeley and UC Santa Barbra. I'll be sad knowing that theres a chance I will have to distance from my family after my senior year for college, however I plan to spend a ton of time with them and making new memories. I also have two french bulldogs, Rocky and Marlow, that I love very much and admire both their playful abilities and lazyness. Ulimately I have goals this year that consist of me striving for the best in terms of grades while making many more amazing memories.
